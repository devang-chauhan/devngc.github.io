          A design technologist and software developer with background in

          Having the ability to
          <span>iteratively</span>
          develop solutions, workflows, products, and businesses is the reason
          why I got interested in technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been in the positions of an architect, a project manager, a
          consultant, a sustainability specialist, a computational designer, and
          a software developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you asked me, I would say that it has been a great career
          progression. In all these roles, I found myself drawn to building
          processes and systems to capture human intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the world of consulting, time is money. In 2016, I learned to code
          out of curiosity to develop a system to automate some parts of the job
          I was doing then in India. I have authored technology in all of the
          jobs since to reduce time in delivering value.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2021, amid the covid pandemic, I got an opportunity to join a
          startup and automate the job I was doing at the time. I took the
          plunge.
