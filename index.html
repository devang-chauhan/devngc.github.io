            <p>
              Having the ability to
              <span>iteratively</span>
              develop solutions, workflows, products, and businesses is the reason
              why I got interested in technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have been in the positions of an architect, a project manager, a
              consultant, a sustainability specialist, a computational designer, and
              a software developer.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you asked me, I would say that it has been a great career
              progression. In all these roles, I found myself drawn to building
              processes and systems to capture human intelligence.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the world of consulting, time is money. In 2016, I learned to code
              out of curiosity to develop a system to automate some parts of the job
              I was doing then in India. I have authored technology in all of the
              jobs since to reduce time in delivering value.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2021, amid the covid pandemic, I got an opportunity to join a
              startup and automate the job I was doing at the time. I took the
              plunge.
