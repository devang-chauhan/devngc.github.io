      <p>At HOK, as a team of computational design leaders we observed that
        every office has a lot of smart people that
        create time-saving workflows in the rush of the projects that
        other people at other offices don't know about. This creates a situation
        where the human intelligence of an
        international firm is isolated and often remains unknown to people
        working in distant offices. We prototyped a platform that
        can enable everyone to share their workflows. The goal of this
        repository was to ultimately help the firm
        offer smart <b>Design Analytics</b>.</p>
